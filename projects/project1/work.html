                    At ITSavvy I work as an Alarm Handler monitoring incoming network alarms and 
                    associating them with known issues, maintenances, or otherwise open a new ticket 
                    to track new issues. I work as an intermediary between clients and carriers to 
                    ensure that tickets receive the most detailed up-to-date information regarding 
                    each step taken in the trouble shooting process.

                    At INOC I worked as a Help Desk Technician assisting multiple clients facing various 
                    issues including account recovery, PC troubleshooting, RMA/Technician Dispatch 
                    coordination, and much more. In my role as Help Desk Technician, it was vital to my 
                    job that work processes be followed closely, tickets be worked quick and efficiently, 
                    and that I include clear and concise updates for all work done.

                    At Wolf Pack Techies I worked as a Level 2 Computer Technician. My role was to 
                    receive/check in incoming customer computers, diagnose issues, research resolutions, 
                    and service the machines. Each step in the process required detailed documentation in 
                    our ticketing system. In this role I provided professional customer service to customers and 
                    worked to educate customers on how they may be able to prevent or resolve issues with their 
                    machines in the future.
