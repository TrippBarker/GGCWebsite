My role was to receive/check in incoming customer computers, diagnose issues, research resolutions, and service the machines. Each step in the process required detailed documentation in our ticketing system. In this role I provided professional customer service to customers and worked to educate customers on how they may be able to prevent or resolve issues with their machines in the future.
